## This is my project for Module 1 Synchrony.

This was the first website created by me, a portfolio website, featuring an Index, Software Development and a Game Design pages for future use. It had been designed for specifically a MacBook Air 16" screen, so it fits perfectly on the specific screen. While it had not been fully finished, it is an example of the design I am capable of, even the background of the index page, which had all been designed by me.
