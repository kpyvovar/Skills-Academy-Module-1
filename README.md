# This is my project for Module 1 Synchrony.

## This was the first website created by me, which was an attempt at a portfolio website, featuring a Software Dvelopment page and a Game Design page for future use. While it had not been fully finished, it is an example of the design I am capable of, even the background of the index page, which aws designed by me.
